**WordleND** is a remake of the popular game Wordle, developed using the Django framework in Python.

Our spin on the classic game includes language support for English, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese users.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run project locally
python3 src/manage.py runserver
```

## Fake Payment API
For class, we integrated with a payment api created by our professor. Other viewers may disregard.

To use, create a file called `config.json` within the src/ folder of this Django project. This json file should have the following format:

```
{ 
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password",
    "access_token": "your-access_token"
}
```

## Notes

As of now, WordleND uses the US-keyboard and does not allow for special characters, though target words in languages other than english may include accents. This is an area for further development.

## Further Development
- Foreign alphabet keyboards
- Refactor Django template extension
- Share game results ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬›
- Add flip animation from left to right
